#### Architecture
___

##### Resets
Never use reset.css library or any wildcard * margin/padding resets, It's to aggressive and unpredictable. Use normalize.css which stabilises browser consistencies and quirks instead.

##### CSS Architecture
The preprocessor of choice is SCSS (Sassy SASS) and not SASS. SMACCS style so our stylesheets are more readable and structuring them after the guidelines from SMACSS. Breaking your styles into more stylesheets is encouraged.

##### Folder Architecture
Folder structure is based on categorization of SMACCS, but also of roughly the most common scenarios. This gives a sense of logical organization for when working with Drupal.

+ **base**
Variables, mixins, basic or most common single element selectors body, p, a, h1, h2, h3
+ **layout**
Larger regions of layout like header, footer, sidebars, reusable design patterns like column lists etc.
+ **modules**
Reusable elements like buttons, forms, elements, or widget components.
+ **vendor**
Contributed CSS libraries from either jquery plugins, or animations libraries

Create your own folders additionally to your needs depending / based on project.
